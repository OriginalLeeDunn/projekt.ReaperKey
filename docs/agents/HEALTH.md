## Drift Findings

| ID | Severity | Area | Description | Status | Opened | Resolved |
|----|----------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| ISS-001 | LOW | SDK | `sdk/package-lock.json` missing — SDK CI would fail on `npm ci` | RESOLVED | 2026-03-24 | 2026-03-24 |
| ISS-002 | LOW | Rust | Unused import `DbSession` in session_key.rs | RESOLVED | 2026-03-24 | 2026-03-24 |
| ISS-003 | MEDIUM | Tests | Account tests `#[ignore]` — Bearer token not wired | RESOLVED | 2026-03-24 | 2026-03-24 |

## Security Findings

_No open findings. RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa Marvin Attack) documented and ignored in `.cargo/audit.toml` — unreachable via SQLite-only usage. See DECISIONS.md._

## Self-Assessment Log

### 2026-03-24 — Governor — Phase 0 Completion Assessment

**Triggered by:** Chain selection + TOOLS.md + TEST_SPECS.md completion

**Phase 0 status:** COMPLETE (all decisions locked, repo skeleton deferred to Phase 1).
**Agent roster:** 18 agents, all ACTIVE, all docs fresh.
**New docs since last assessment:** TOOLS.md (tooling reference), TEST_SPECS.md (40+ behavioral specs), GOVERNANCE.md, HEALTH.md.
**Drift:** None — no code exists yet to drift against.
**Chain locked:** Base (8453). EntryPoint, bundler, paymaster all specified in DECISIONS.md and STACK.md.
**Security:** No findings. Security gates in SECURITY.md are Phase 1 targets.

**Readiness for Phase 1:**
- Backend Engineer has: role file, tools (cargo commands), test specs (SPEC-001 through SPEC-040), API contract (STACK.md), data model (STACK.md).
- DevOps Engineer first task: create repo skeleton + Makefile + CI scaffold.
- QA Engineer first task: confirm test specs cover all STACK.md endpoints (they do).

**Overall: READY TO BEGIN PHASE 1.**

---

### 2026-03-25 — Monitor Agent — Phase 1 Completion / Post-Deploy Assessment

**Triggered by:** PR #9 merge to main, v0.1.0 tag + push.

**Phase 1 status:** COMPLETE. All routes implemented and tested. All CI jobs green.
**Deployment #1:** a8c6924 — 19 tests passing (16 Rust + 3 SDK). Coverage 72.6% (gate 70%).
**All prior issues resolved:** ISS-001 (package-lock.json), ISS-002 (unused import), ISS-003 (Bearer auth wiring).
**Open GH Issues:** #8 (path to 80% coverage — intent tests require mock chain adapter, Phase 2 work).
**Security:** RUSTSEC-2023-0071 documented ignore — unreachable via SQLite-only usage.
**Agent system:** Hard Rules #10/#11 active. ci-issue.yml live — auto-opens GH Issues on CI failure.
**Lessons encoded:** cargo fmt Hard Rule, GitHub Issues as single source of truth both in AGENTS.md + TOOLS.md.

**Readiness for Phase 2:**
- SDK Engineer: TypeScript SDK skeleton exists, 3 client tests passing, ESLint clean.
- Phase 2 scope: full SDK implementation, React hooks tested, reference app.
- Blocking: none. Dev branch ready for Phase 2 feature work.

**Overall: PHASE 1 COMPLETE. HEALTHY. READY FOR PHASE 2.**

---

### 2026-03-25 — Monitor Agent — Phase 2 Completion / Post-Deploy Assessment

**Triggered by:** Phase 2 SDK merge to main.

**Phase 2 status:** COMPLETE. SDK hooks fully implemented and tested. All CI jobs green.
**Deployment #2:** efce0e5 — 43 tests passing (25 Rust + 18 SDK). Coverage 87.18% (gate 80%).
**SDK coverage:** 15 React hook tests (useLogin×4, useAccount×4, useSessionKey×3, useSendIntent×4).
**Rust coverage:** 9 new intent integration tests with wiremock mock bundler (SPEC-030 through SPEC-035).
**Silent bug fixed:** `client.ts` was casting snake_case JSON directly to camelCase TypeScript types — all fields were `undefined`. Explicit mapper functions added.
**CI governance fixes:** push trigger narrowed (feat/fix/ops branches no longer trigger push CI); merge strategy switched to merge commits to prevent dev/main divergence.
**Hard Rules:** #12 added — no direct commits to main, ever.
**Open GH Issues:** #18 (SPEC-004 + SPEC-006), #19 (SPEC-201 SQL injection — unignore), #20 (config.toml.example), #21 (useRecovery hook), #22 (Phase 3 reference app).

**Readiness for Phase 3:**
- Phase 3 scope: `example/` reference app demonstrating full GhostKey flow.
- Blocked by: #21 (useRecovery + generateSessionKey) must land first.
- CI green. Dev in sync with main.

**Overall: PHASE 2 COMPLETE. HEALTHY. READY FOR PHASE 3.**

### 2026-03-25 — Monitor Agent — Phase 3 Completion / Post-Deploy Assessment

**Triggered by:** PR #32 merge to main (Phase 3 reference app + all supporting issues #18–#22).

**Phase 3 status:** COMPLETE. All GH issues #18–#22 resolved and merged. CI all green.
**Deployment #3:** 1b23d76 — 53 tests passing (27 Rust + 26 SDK). TESTS_IGNORED = 0.
**New SDK tests:** 4 crypto tests (`generateSessionKey` — uniqueness, SHA-256 correctness, hex format) + 4 `useRecovery` tests (idle state, success, error, reset).
**New Rust tests:** SPEC-004 (expired token → 401 `token_expired`) + SPEC-006 (11th login → 429 `rate_limited`) — total auth tests now 7.
**Critical bug fixed:** `AppError::Unauthorized` `IntoResponse` was always emitting `"invalid_token"` — inner `&'static str` was ignored. SPEC-004 was failing because of this; fixed in `error.rs` with `*code` dereference.
**TESTS_IGNORED reduced 1 → 0:** SPEC-201 SQL injection test unignored — SQLx parameterized queries + SHA-256 credential hashing confirmed safe.
**Reference app:** `example/` demonstrates full non-custodial flow — private key displayed in amber to prove it never leaves the client.
**WebCrypto polyfill:** vitest jsdom environment doesn't expose `globalThis.crypto.subtle` — fixed via `tests/setup.crypto.ts` + `setupFiles` in `vitest.config.ts`.
**Build fix:** `tsup.config.ts` created — `npm run build` was failing "No input files" without it.
**GH Issue #33 opened:** `AppError::Internal` swallows error cause in logs — Phase 4 work item for production ops observability.
**Open Phase 4 issues:** #33 (error cause logging). Additional Phase 4 issues (#34+) to be filed.

**Readiness for Phase 4:**
- Security Lead: rate limiting gaps, CORS tightening, OWASP review, PII audit in logs.
- DevOps Agent: deployment docs, dependency audit, structured logging.
- Blocked by: none. Dev in sync with main. CI green.

**Overall: PHASE 3 COMPLETE. HEALTHY. READY FOR PHASE 4.**

---

### 2026-03-25 — Monitor Agent — v0.3.1 Post-Deploy Assessment

**Triggered by:** PR #46 merge to main (pre-Phase 4 validation gap fixes, issues #36–#43).

**v0.3.1 changes:**
- `Retry-After: 60` header on all 429 responses (closes #36)
- Route `/recovery/init` → `/recovery/initiate` (closes #37)
- `AppError::InvalidCalldata` → HTTP 400 + `"invalid_calldata"` (closes #38)
- SDK `coverage.thresholds` enforced at 80% in vitest.config.ts (closes #39)
- `GhostKeyClient.createAccount(address)` single param + `chainName()` helper (closes #40)
- SPEC-011, SPEC-022, SPEC-031, SPEC-032, SPEC-033 tests added (closes #41)
- `ApiResult<T>` exported from `@ghostkey/sdk` (closes #42)
- Rate limiter replaced with true sliding window `VecDeque<Instant>` (closes #43)
- 12 new client HTTP method tests; `index.ts` excluded from coverage

**Test counts:** 32 Rust + 38 SDK = **70 total**, 0 ignored.
**SDK coverage:** 96.83% lines, 100% functions, 80.48% branches.
**GitHub releases:** v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0, v0.3.1 all published.
**All GH issues #36–#43 closed.** Only open issue: #33 (Phase 4 scope).

**Readiness for Phase 4:** CI green, 0 ignored tests, 0 open pre-Phase-4 issues. All validation gaps resolved.

**Overall: v0.3.1 DEPLOYED. HEALTHY. READY FOR PHASE 4.**
