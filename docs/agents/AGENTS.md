## Claude Orchestration Protocol

When Claude acts as the Orchestrating Agent in a session:

### Before Starting Any Multi-Area Task
1. Read `docs/agents/HEALTH.md` — understand current system state and open gaps
2. Read `docs/agents/corp/ORCHESTRATOR.md` — current phase and checklist
3. Read `docs/agents/INBOX.md` — any pending memos from the founder
4. Identify which agent(s) own the work being requested

### Assigning Work
Each area of work maps to a specific agent. Claude must mentally (or explicitly in PR descriptions) assign work:
- Rust backend changes → Backend Engineer Agent
- TypeScript SDK changes → SDK Engineer Agent
- CI/infra changes → DevOps Agent
- Test additions → QA Agent
- Docs updates → Docs Agent
- Security review → Security Lead
- DB migrations → Backend Engineer + Architect review
- Smart contract work → Contract Engineer Agent
- Dependency changes → Dep Scanner review

### PR Conventions
PR title format: `[AgentName] type: description`
Examples:
- `[Backend] fix: add create_if_missing to db.rs`
- `[SDK] feat: UserOp construction with permissionless.js`
- `[DevOps] chore: update release workflow binary path`
- `[Docs] docs: post-demo audit — GAP-001/002/003 documented`

### INBOX/OUTBOX Protocol
- User leaves memos at `docs/agents/INBOX.md` (or via the Agent Dashboard at localhost:3002)
- At session start, Claude reads INBOX.md and processes pending items as the Orchestrator
- Responses and status updates go to `docs/agents/OUTBOX.md`
- Processed items are marked `[DONE]` in INBOX.md

## Orchestration Protocol

### Task Flow
```
PRD → Orchestrator → Architect → Engineering Corps
                              → Security Division (parallel)
                              → Audit & Compliance (parallel)
                              → Operations (on deploy)

Governor runs continuously → monitors all of the above for drift and staleness
```

### Phase-to-Agent Mapping

| Phase              | Lead Agent         | Support Agents                        |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Phase 0 (Align)    | Orchestrator       | Architect, Compliance, Governor       |
| Phase 1 (Engine)   | Backend Eng        | Architect, Security Lead, QA          |
| Phase 2 (SDK)      | SDK Eng            | Backend Eng, QA, Docs                 |
| Phase 3 (Ref App)  | SDK Eng            | Backend Eng, QA, Docs                 |
| Phase 4 (Harden)   | Security Lead      | All Engineering, DevOps, Monitor      |
| Phase 5 (Launch)   | Orchestrator       | Docs, DevOps, Audit Lead, Governor    |

## Hard Rules (all agents must follow)

1. **Non-custodial first.** Never suggest storing private keys server-side.
2. **One clear path.** When proposing solutions, lead with the simplest option.
3. **Security is not optional.** Security review required before any PR merges.
4. **Audit trail.** Every significant decision gets logged in `DECISIONS.md`.
5. **Scope discipline.** Non-Goals in the PRD are hard blockers — refuse and explain.
6. **Verify before recommending.** If referencing a file or function — confirm it exists first.
7. **No financial features in v0.** Swaps, lending, custody, ramps are out of scope.
8. **Docs are truth.** If docs and code diverge, log a drift finding — do not silently fix.
9. **Living docs.** Every governance doc carries a `Last Verified` date. If stale, re-verify before using.
10. **Format before commit.** Run `cargo fmt` on ALL Rust changes before every commit. Never commit unformatted code. CI enforces `cargo fmt --check` — a format failure wastes an entire CI run. The pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` enforces this locally. Activate it with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
11. **GitHub Issues are the single source of truth for open problems.** Every CI failure, security finding, or drift is a GitHub Issue first. HEALTH.md and DEPLOYMENTS.md reference issue numbers — they do not replace issues.
12. **No direct commits to main. Ever.** All changes — code, docs, config, ops — go through a branch and PR. CI must be green before merge. Force-pushing main to remove an unauthorized commit is acceptable recovery, but the violation must be noted in the PR that replaces it.

## How Agents Plug Into the Product

Once the product ships, agents re-attach as operational roles:

```
GhostKey Runtime
       │
       ├── Governor          → watches doc freshness, system health
       ├── Monitor Agent     → watches logs, alerts on anomalies
       ├── Security Agent    → scans new PRs, flags regressions
       ├── Audit Agent       → verifies non-custodial constraints post-deploy
       ├── Docs Agent        → keeps docs in sync with API changes
       └── Dependency Agent  → watches for CVEs in Rust/TS deps continuously
```

Operational mode is activated by reading this file with:
> "You are operating in PRODUCTION mode. Read `docs/agents/HEALTH.md` for current system state."

---

## Spawning a Subagent

When spawning a subagent, pass:
1. `docs/agents/AGENTS.md` — team context and hard rules
2. `docs/agents/GOVERNANCE.md` — governance protocol
3. The agent's own role file (e.g., `docs/agents/security/SEC_LEAD.md`)
4. `docs/agents/HEALTH.md` — current system state
5. The current phase from `v1prd.md`
6. Any relevant codebase files

Example prompt prefix:
```
You are the [ROLE NAME] agent for GhostKey.
Source of truth lives in docs/.
Read docs/agents/AGENTS.md for team context and hard rules.
Read docs/agents/GOVERNANCE.md for governance protocol.
Read docs/agents/[path]/[ROLE].md for your specific mission.
Read docs/agents/HEALTH.md for current system state.
Current phase: [Phase N].
Task: [task description]
```
